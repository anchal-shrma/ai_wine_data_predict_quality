# ai_wine_data_predict_quality
I started the proejct by loading the wine dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality and filtered it to include only red wines. The 'type' column was dropped as it was not directly relevant for predicting wine quality for red wine. The target variable 'quality' was categorized into three levels: Low, Medium, and High, to simplify the prediction task. In the feature engineering process, I then created two new features: 'sulfur_ratio', which is the ratio of total sulfur dioxide to free sulfur dioxide, and 'log_density', which is the logarithm of the density. Based on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and domain knowledge, I dropped less important features, including 'residual sugar', 'free sulfur dioxide', 'total sulfur dioxide', and 'density', as they were not significant for the model's performance. So, the final features used are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, chlorides, pH, sulphates, alcohol, quality (categorical), sulfur_ratio, and log_density.

The best model among all tested models is the RandomForestClassifier. This model was selected by the AutoML function based on the optimization criteria set for the experiment. The Random Forest algorithm performed well compared to the other models, achieving the highest performance across the evaluated metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

The best performance was achieved by the RandomForestClassifier with an F1 score that balances precision and recall. Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall indicates the model's ability to capture all positive cases. The Random Forest model showed a strong ability to balance these two metrics, making it the most reliable choice among the models tested.
