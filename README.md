# ai_wine_data_predict_quality
In this project, I worked on predicting the quality of red wines based on various physicochemical properties such as acidity, alcohol content, pH, and sulfur levels. The dataset was preprocessed by cleaning and transforming the features, including categorizing the 'quality' column into Low, Medium, and High classes. I created additional features like 'sulfur_ratio' and 'log_density' to enhance the prediction model. Several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, were tested to determine the best model for wine quality classification. After comparing the models, the Random Forest Classifier provided the best performance, achieving high accuracy and a strong F1 score, making it the most reliable model for this task. This project demonstrates how feature engineering and model selection can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models in classification tasks.
