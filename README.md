# ai_wine_data_predict_quality
I started the proejct by loading the wine dataset and filtered it to include only red wines. The 'type' column was dropped as it was not directly relevant for predicting wine quality for red wine. The target variable 'quality' was categorized into three levels: Low, Medium, and High, to simplify the prediction task. In the feature engineering process, I then created two new features: 'sulfur_ratio', which is the ratio of total sulfur dioxide to free sulfur dioxide, and 'log_density', which is the logarithm of the density. Based on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and domain knowledge, I dropped less important features, including 'residual sugar', 'free sulfur dioxide', 'total sulfur dioxide', and 'density', as they were not significant for the model's performance. So, the final features used are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, chlorides, pH, sulphates, alcohol, quality (categorical), sulfur_ratio, and log_density.
